 *         The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as
 *         follows: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...
 * 
 *         1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
 * 
 *         11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
 * 
 *         21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
 * 
 *         Given an integer n, generate the nth sequence.
 * 
 *         Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
