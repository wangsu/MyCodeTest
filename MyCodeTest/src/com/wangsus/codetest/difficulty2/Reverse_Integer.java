 *         Reverse digits of an integer.
 * 
 *         Example1: x = 123, return 321 Example2: x = -123, return -321

 * 
 *         Have you thought about this? Here are some good questions to ask
 *         before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought
 *         through this!
 * 
 *         If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie,
 *         cases such as 10, 100.
 * 
 *         Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the
 *         input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows.
 *         How should you handle such cases?
 * 
 *         Throw an exception? Good, but what if throwing an exception is not an
 *         option? You would then have to re-design the function (ie, add an
 *         extra parameter).
