 *         Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned
 *         at the first index of the array.
 * 
 *         Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that
 *         position.
 * 
 *         Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
 * 
 *         For example:
 * 
 *         Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]
 * 
 * 
 *         The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1
 *         step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
