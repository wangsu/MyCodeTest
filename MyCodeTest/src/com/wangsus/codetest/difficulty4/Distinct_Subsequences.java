/**
 * @author Su Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct
 *         subsequences of T in S.
 * 
 *         A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the
 *         original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters
 *         without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining
 *         characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is
 *         not).
 * 
 *         Here is an example: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
 * 
 *         Return 3.
