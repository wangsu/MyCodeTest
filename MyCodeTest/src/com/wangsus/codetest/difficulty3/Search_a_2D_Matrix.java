 *         Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n
 *         matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
 * 
 *         Integers in each row are sorted from left to right. The first integer
 *         of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row. For
 *         example,
 * 
 *         Consider the following matrix:
 * 
 *         [
 * 
 *         [1, 3, 5, 7],
 * 
 *         [10, 11, 16, 20],
 * 
 *         [23, 30, 34, 50]
 * 
 *         ]
 * 
 *         Given target = 3, return true.
